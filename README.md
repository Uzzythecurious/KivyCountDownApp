# KivyCountDownApp
Countdown app built using python, kivy and buildozer for android. 

<p>Don't bother with buildozer on MACOS just use an ubuntu virtual machine on virtual box or qemu to do it. I went down a rabbit hole and it just wouldnt build. Save yourself!</p>

<p>The clock icon and background png files are to be added to your buildozer init file as an icon and splash page for a loading screen</p>
